                    rules posted by us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and
                    understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                    Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to
                    the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to
                    others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to
                    act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of
                    these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of
                    the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity and
                    enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or

                    drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of
                    these
                    Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.</span></div>
